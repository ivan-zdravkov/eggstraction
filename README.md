#Eggstraction

Eggstraction is a Unity3D platformer game, supporting [Leap Motion](https://www.leapmotion.com/) motion control as well as keyboard and in the future mobile input. The game features a  randomly generated infinite platform, expanding vertically upwards and a character, whose goal is to reach the highest maximum point, without falling off the screen. As the game progresses the screen moves up at an increasing speed making survival increasingly more difficult. When the character reaches score 100, the game allows for a double jump.
